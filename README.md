# Day_23_Turtle_crossing_game_capstone_project_2
Built a Turtle Crossing game in Python with the turtle module. The player guides a turtle across a road while avoiding cars. The game uses object-oriented programming, collision detection, and features increasing difficulty with each level. This project was a great way to enhance my skills in game development and OOP concepts.
